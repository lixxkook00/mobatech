                        On earth, the tiger is a species with the greatest strength, ability to hunt and fight, and is highly adaptable in the harsh jungle environment. Therefore, a special force was established with 1575Â tiger warriors selected through many rigorous training, testing, and evaluation courses. They are sent to find and explore a new planet in order to assist in the evacuation of all creatures on Earth to this new location.
